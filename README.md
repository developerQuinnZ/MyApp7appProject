# MyApp7appProject
The Schema is built, I know can can force min and max values if I make it's data type numbers, I need to add some Regex /^[0-9]*10$/ 
so only numbers are returned, or I can save them as strings, and make a .length check between 10-13, still learning how to do validation.
I have gotten Mocha installed on another local project, and once I get further along on this one, will add it to allow for TDD.
